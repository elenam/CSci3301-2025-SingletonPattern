/*
Question 1: add 'else' to the 'if' statements in fill(), boil(),
and drain(). Add print statements for the successful tasks 
("Draining the boiler...") and for the failed attempts 
("Can't drain an empty boiler")

Question 2: in ChocolateController try a sequence of steps that isn't possible,
such as draining an empty boiler. Make sure all the prints are correct.

Question 3: change to enum implementation of singleton (see the example in enumS
package) and retry the steps in question 2.
